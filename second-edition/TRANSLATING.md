# Translation process

1. Ask for the access rights to the french fork on the [initial issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/808).
2. Choose a chapter to work on, from the ["french translations" board](https://github.com/quadrifoglio/rust-book-fr/projects/1). Make sure that the original writers marked it as "frozen", and
that the source is is up to date with the [original version](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).
3. Please create a [branch](https://github.com/quadrifoglio/rust-book-fr/branches) in order to work on your translation.
4. Translate the chapter.
5. When you are satisfied with your translation, and want feedback/help on your work, please open a [PR](https://github.com/quadrifoglio/rust-book-fr/pulls).

When the PR is created, you can ask for a review from the other contributors.
You can also help by taking a look at the opened PRs, do not hesitate to comment or provide corrections.
